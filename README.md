# Machine Learning Exploration Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects related to various Machine Learning topics. 
The projects cover a wide range of techniques and approaches, with a particular focus on two main areas:

- <b>Computer Vision:</b> Projects such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and others focused on image processing and generation.
- <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>: Projects exploring techniques in text processing and language models.

### Purpose
The primary goal of these projects was to create hands-on exercises to test and apply newly learned techniques. 
Throughout the repository, you can find implementations that explore different methodologies and approaches within the field of Machine Learning.

Each project is well-documented, providing detailed explanations of the techniques used, the challenges encountered, and insights gained during the development process.
