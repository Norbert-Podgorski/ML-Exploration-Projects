# Recursive Architectures Comparison

## Description
This project aims to build a sentiment analysis model using a dataset containing movie reviews. <br>
The primary goal is to compare the performance of various recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures: 
- <b>RNN</b>
- <b>GRU</b>
- <b>LSTM</b>
- <b>Bidirectional LSTM</b>


Each of these architectures will be evaluated to determine their effectiveness in predicting sentiment from text.

The project consists of several stages, including dataset loading, preprocessing, model implementation, training and evaluation.
