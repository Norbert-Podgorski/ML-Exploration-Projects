# U-Net Segmentation

## Description
This project focuses on performing image segmentation using a U-Net architecture implemented with TensorFlow. <br>
The project involves creating a custom U-Net model for segmentation tasks, alongside developing a custom data generator that efficiently loads image batches from disk during training, instead of storing all images in memory. <br>
The aim is to accurately segment images of animals from a provided dataset.
