# Backpropagation

# Description
This project contains a Python implementation of a simple neural network model using only NumPy to recognize the XOR logical problem. <br>
The network consists of linear layers and ReLU activation functions, with Mean Squared Error (MSE) used to compute the loss function. <br>
The model is trained using backpropagation with a basic Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm.
